class BaseSshClientTestCase(TestCase):
    """Base class for several ssh client test cases classes.

    ==Introduction==

    This class contains most of the machinery required to tests programs
    that require a SSH connections. It takes care of setting-up, starting,
    stopping and cleaning up after your tests are done.

    Setting-up means generating:

    - host key pairs (RSA, DSA and ECDSA)
    - a configuration file

    for the SSH daemon to be started. As well as:

    - a key pair
    - an authorized_keys file
    - adds an entry for the new home ~/.ssh_config file

    for the current user

    All those data are, by default written and stored in a
    'tests/fixtures/sshd' directory within the working directory of the
    test runner that runs the test. This can be changed by overriding
    the ``FIXTURE_PATH`` class attribute of the test case.

    .. example::

       Assuming you work in an environment where you run your test from
       the base directory of your project, i.e. somewhat like this::

         user@hsot: workdir$ pwd
         /path/to/workdir
         user@host: workdir$ ls
         module1/       module2/        setup.py        tests/
         scripts/
         user@host: workdir$ python -m tests
         ...
         user@host: workdir$ python-coverage run -m tests --sources=module1,module2
         ...
         user@host: workdir$ python-coverage html
         ...

       Then the files necessary to run the SSH daemon are stored in the
        ``/path/to/workdir/tests/fixtures/sshd``  directory.

    Once the SSH daemon has started we update the current user's
    ``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` file (see :man:`ssh-keyscan`) so that the
    tests are not bothered by the host key validation prompt.

    Once all this is done, the tests start being executed.

    .. note::

       All tests belonging to a class derived from this one will see their
       tests run against the same SSH daemon instance, it is not restarted
       between two tests.


    After all your tests have ran, all the above generated files are removed
    and your ``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` file is restored to its previous state
    (to avoid having tons of useless host key in it, since we through all
    those keys away).


    ==Configuration options==

    Lots of parameters can be configured:

    ===Network parameters===

    - ``BIND_ADDRESS``: the address the daemon will listen to. The default is
      the loopback address (``127.0.0.1``) for obvious security and test
      insulation reasons.
    - ``PORT``: the TCP port the daemon will listen to. The default is 2200.

    ===Auxiliary programs===

    Obviously OpenSSH is required for this test harness to work. But also
    :man:`ssh-keygen` and :man:`ssh-keyscan` which are standard tools
    included in the OpenSSH distribution. Depending on your distribution they
    might be installed in different places.

    - ``SSHD_BIN``: set the path to the OpenSSH sshd daemon. The default is
      ``/usr/sbin/sshd`` as installed on Debian systems.
    - ``SSH_KEYGEN_BIN``: set the path to ``ssh-keygen``. The default path
      is ``/usr/bin/ssh-keygen``
    - ``SSH_KEYSCAN_BIN``: set the path to ``ssh-keyscan``. The default path
      is ``/usr/bin/ssh-keyscan``.

    ===Authorized keys options===

    As already told, this test harness generates a ``authorized_keys`` file
    for you that contains the user public key generated during setup. Such
    a file may contain options in front of the public key to further configure
    or restrict the connection. You can specify such options by setting
    the ``AUTHORIZED_KEY_OPTIONS`` class attribute of your test case. Its
    value must be a string that contain valid options (the string you provide
    is not validated).

    ===Environment variables===

    You ask SSHD to set certain environment variables for you upon connection.
    To specify those you need to override the ``SSH_ENVIRONMENT`` class
    attribute. It is a dictionary which keys are the names of the environment
    variables to set and values will be the value of the environment variable
    value.

    By default the dictionary is empty, and use of environment variables is
    disabled in SSHD configuration. Adding one or more key/value pair to the
    dictionnary implicitly enables their use.

    .. todo::

       - Improve reporting problems internal to this testcase class. As most
         of the work takes place in the setUpClass/tearDownClass methods,
         failures happening here are prone to messing things up. Work is needed
         to make this far more bullet proof.

       - Having OpenSSH daemonizing itself, makes reliably monitor that is does
         not crash, fails to start, and such quite difficult...
         Assuming it is a quite proven soft, we could monitor its pidfile
         with something like iNotify...

       - We good offer an option to force server restarts in between tests.
         Not sure if it would be easy to make it relayable on a moderately
         loaded machine.

       - Generate only one ECDSA host key (instead of ECDSA+DSA+RSA) to lower
         the start-up time treshold.

       - Chroot the connection to the SSH daemon within the project directory
         (i.e. ``/path/to/workdir`` to follow-up with the above example).

       - Provide means set autorized key options on a per-test basis.

       - What about the SFTP subsystem ? (Should be disable by default)

       - Append some random ascii bytes to the SSH_CONFIG_{OPEN,CLOSE}_TAG
         values so that tests can be nested or ran concurrently (there surely
         is more to do to achieve that but it is still one required bit).
