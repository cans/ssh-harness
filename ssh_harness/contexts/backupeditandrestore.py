    :param str suffix: the suffix to append the name of the file to create
        its backup copy (default is 'backup').
    :param str mode: the mode in which open the file (see :py:func:`open`)

    All keyword arguments accepted by the :py:func:`open` function are
    accepted.

    This context manager tryes to make the changes to the file appear atomic.
    To that end as well as creating a backup copy, it create an *edition* copy
    of the target file.
    When entering the context the file being modified is in fact not the target
    file but its *edition-copy*
    When the contex is exited the *edition-file* replaces the target file
    (atomically if the OS platform supports it, i.e. atomicity is guaranteed
    on POSIX system).

    You need to keep a reference to the context manager up to the time
    you want to restore the file, which is achieve by calling its
    :py:meth:`restore` method.

    .. note::

       The mode 'r' is prohibited here are it makes no sense to backup
       a file to do nothing with it.
