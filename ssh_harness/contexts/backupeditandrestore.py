    :param str suffix: the suffix to append the name of the file to create
        its backup copy (default is 'backup').
    :param str mode: the mode in which open the file (see :py:func:`open`)
    :param str context: the context keywork lets you partition the set of
        files you back-up (see methods :py:meth:`clear` and
        :py:meth:`clear_context`)

    Additionnaly keyword arguments accepted by the :py:func:`open` function
    are accepted, with some restriction on mode (see. note
        below).

    This context manager tryes to make the changes to the file appear atomic.
    To that end as well as creating a backup copy, it create an *edition*
    copy of the target file.
    When entering the context the file being modified is in fact not the target
    file but its *edition-copy*
    When the contex is exited the *edition-file* replaces the target file
    (atomically if the OS platform supports it, i.e. atomicity is guaranteed
    on POSIX system).

    You later restore the file either with either of the :py:meth:`restore`
    py:meth:`clear` and :py:meth:`clear_context` methods (see their respective
    descriptions).

    :Example:

        with BackupEditAndRestore('context', './my-precious', 'a') as f:
            f.write(data)
        with BackupEditAndRestore('context', './my-other-precious', 'a') as f:

        BackupEditAndRestore.clear_context('context')

       The mode 'r' is prohibited here as it makes no sense to backup
       a file to do nothing with it.
